1. Breadth-First Search (BFS)
Explores Level by Level: BFS explores all nodes at the present depth level before moving on to nodes at the next depth level.
Uses a Queue: A queue is used to track nodes to visit, ensuring nodes are processed in the order they were discovered.
Shortest Path in Unweighted Graphs: BFS can find the shortest path between two nodes in an unweighted graph.
Time Complexity: The time complexity is O(V+E), where 

V is the number of vertices and 

E is the number of edges.
Applications: Commonly used in shortest path algorithms, peer-to-peer networks, and solving puzzles like mazes.


2. Depth-First Search (DFS)
Explores Deep Before Wide: DFS explores as far as possible down one branch before backtracking to explore other branches.
Uses a Stack: DFS uses a stack (or recursion) to remember the path of visited nodes and backtrack as needed.
Does Not Guarantee Shortest Path: DFS doesn't necessarily find the shortest path; it's more suited for exploring deeper connections.
Time Complexity: The time complexity is O(V+E), similar to BFS, as it must visit every vertex and edge.
Applications: Useful in topological sorting, cycle detection in graphs, and solving connected components.


3. Best-First Search (Greedy Search)
Heuristic-Based Search: Best-First Search uses a priority queue to explore nodes based on a heuristic, typically aiming for the "best" path first.
Greedy Approach: The algorithm selects the node that appears to be closest to the goal, prioritizing local optimal choices.
Uses a Priority Queue: Nodes are sorted by their heuristic values, typically using a priority queue (min-heap) to expand the node with the lowest cost.
Doesn't Guarantee Optimal Solution: Although it may find a solution quickly, Best-First Search does not guarantee the optimal or shortest path.
Applications: Commonly used in AI and game development, such as pathfinding (e.g., A* search uses a combination of Best-First and other criteria).
